# UCL_Draw

In this repo, I've added a Python code to simulate the UEFA CHAMPIONS LEAGUE draw.

The code use the default team that attend the final stage in the season 2021/22.

The teams are picked randomly, but the code could easily edit in order to give as input the drawn team and to return the avaiable match temas.
